# dj4e-final-army-men-combat

This is my final project for the Django For Everybody Course

## Initial Goals

My project will be to take the Army Men Combat tabletop game previously available from One Page Rules and create an application where users can create and persistently game rosters. Users will also be able to access the v2.0 rules for their lists in context, or download the PDF of the rules to make physical printouts.

The rosters will utilize several inter-related tables for unit selection and associated equipment selections. The builder will also ensure that the lists conform to the game rules.

The application will display the lists in a clear fashion for quick reference during gameplay.
